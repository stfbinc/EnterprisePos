Working with the Enterprise Cart via API is also going to teach you some things about the Enterprise X ERP Application.

First, the Enterprise X ERP App is here:  https://www.stfb.net/EnterpriseX/index.php?page=ByPassLogin&interface=default

When you enter new customers in the cart, they show up here: 
Main Menu -> Receivables -> Customers -> View Customers

The inventory is drawn from this screen here:
Main Menu -> Inventory -> Items & Stock -> View Inventory on Hand

When you enter an order transaction, it shows up here:
Main Menu -> Receivables -> View Orders or View Orders Simple

The order will also show up in the Transactions screen for the individual inventory item here:
Main Menu -> Inventory -> Items & Stock -> View Inventory Items -> Select the item from the order, it will appear on "Transactions" tab 

Shopping Cart Setup Options are here:
Main Menu -> ECommerce -> Cart Setup -> Cart Setup
